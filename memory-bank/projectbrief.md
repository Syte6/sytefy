# Project Brief

Sytefy is a FastAPI + Next.js digital secretary rebuilt with Clean Architecture, SOLID code, and OWASP-grade security. Core capabilities include authentication, user/customer management, appointment scheduling, finances, and notifications. PostgreSQL serves as the persistent store; every module must expose domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers with strict separation and centralized configuration. Deliverables must enable modular growth (Auth → Users → Customers → Appointments → Finances) and maintain ≥80% automated test coverage.
